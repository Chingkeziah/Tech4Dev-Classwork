    <!-- as best practice, always put your script element at the bottom of your html page
    this is because it passes the javascript file from top to bottom so putting it in the head section
    would make it neglect the rest of the content of the page
    secondly, the code written within the script tag is usually used for the content of that page and so 
    putting it at the end of the body tag serves as security that all the elements are rendered by the browser.
    there are however exceptions to this. -->
