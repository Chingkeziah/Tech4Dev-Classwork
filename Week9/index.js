/* javascript is one of the most popular and widely used programing and scripting language in the world right now
it is commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. it was originally designed
to run only on browser. however, in 2009, Ryan Doll took the open source javascript engine in chrome and 
imbedded it inside a c++ program called node. with the help of node, we can now run javascript code outside of 
a browser.
Ecmascript is a specification which defines standards for scripting languages while javascript is a programing 
language which confirms to this specification

console.log('hello world');
// this refers to a statement which is a piece of code that expresses an action to be carried out and it must be terminated by a semi colon(;)
// what we have in the single quotes is called a string which is a sequence of characters

// variables
// variables are used to store data temporally in a computers memory and give that memory location a name
// before es6 we used var keyword to declare a variable but going forward from es6, the best practice is to use the let keyword to declare a variable
let name = 'keziah';
console.log(name);
// by default, variables in javascript are undefined
/* rules for naming variables
- you cannot use a reserved keyword for example; let, if, else
- they should be meaningful. what is the purpose of the variable?
- they cannot start with a number e.g, 1name;
- they cannot contain a space or hyphen( -)
- if you want to declare multiple variables, you can declare them on one line and use commas to separate them
   but the modern best practice is to declare each variable on a single line.
