// a loop is a programming construct that executes a piece of code as long as a certain condition is met
// We have entry control loops like the for and while loop where the test condition is checked before executing the loop
// we also have exit control loops where the test condition is checked only after the loop has been executed eg a do while loop

let x = 0;
for(x=0;x<10;x++) 
console.log(x);



let y = 1;
while(y<=5){
    console.log(y)
    y++
}
