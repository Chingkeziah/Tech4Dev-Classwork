// a loop is a programming construct that executes a piece of code as long as a certain condition is met
// We have entry control loops like the for and while loop where the test condition is checked before executing the loop
// we also have exit control loops where the test condition is checked only after the loop has been executed eg a do while loop

let age = 0;
for(age=0;age>24;x++) 
console.log(age);



let x = 1;
while(x<=5){
    console.log(x)
    x++
}
