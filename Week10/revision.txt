We were given a short break or lets call it holiday for about two weeks or so after which we resumed class.
This week we were doing a thorough revision of what has already been done in javascript as well as in git.
We touched stuffs like variables which can be declared using the let, var and const keyword.
We again looked at functions, arraya and objects. 
Furthermore, we revised basic command line commands like;touch, mkdir, cd, 
In addition, we looked at git commands like; git clone, git init, git add, git status, git commit -m "",
git pull, git push, git branch, git checkout, git fetch, git merge,
